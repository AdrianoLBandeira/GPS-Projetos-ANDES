Based on the information needs and available data present on developing software (e.g., Jira, GitHub, Sonnar etc), and using networked ontologies (e.g, Scrum Reference Ontology and Continuous Integration Reference Ontology) as an interlingua, an integration solution called The Band defines and implements a software architecture that integrates data from different
applications and shows meaningful information (e.g., in dashboards) to enable data-driven software development.

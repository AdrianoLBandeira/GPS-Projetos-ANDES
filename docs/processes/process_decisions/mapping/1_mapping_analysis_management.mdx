Presents the processes applied to map Analysis` artifact and software management artifacts.

## Mapping Use Case for Backlog Entities

| **Task**                   | **Decision**                      | **Example**                        | 
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
|Create EPIC on Software Management Tools from Use Case|For each Use Case of an analysis model, it will be mapped to an EPIC in the project management tool or backlog|The Use Case 'Scholarship Payment' will be mapped to the EPIC 'Scholarship Payment'.|
|Create User Story for each Use Case Event|For each Use Case`s Event of an analysis model, it will be mapped to an User Story in the project management tool or backlog|The Use Case`s event 'Pay the Scholarship' will be mapped to the User Story 'Pay the Scholarship'.|
|Create Task to each Use Case`s events|For each Use Case`s Event of an analysis model, it will be create an **Implementation task** and a **Testing task** on management tool or backlog |Imagine we are implementing a project where there is a separate front-end and back-end. Therefore, four tasks will be created for the 'Pay Scholarship' event: (i) **Implement Use Case in Backend**, (ii) **Implement Use Case in Front-end**, (iii) **Implement Test in Backend**, and (iv) **Implement Test in Front-end**|


## Mapping Class Diagram for Project Class Diagram

| **Task**                       | **Decision**                      | **Example**                        | 
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
|Create a Task to Create/update a Project Model|When a Domain Problem Model is created or update a Task to create a Project Model |A Domain Diagram Model is created or updated is created a task to create or update a Project Diagram Model.|

## Mapping Low-fidelity prototyping for interface design project

| **Task**                       | **Decision**                      | **Example**                        | 
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
|Create Task to project User Interface |When a User interface is created or update, is created a Task to project/update a User Interface|Login interface was designed then a task to project the login interface is created|
|Create Task to valite User Interface |When a User interface is created or update, is created a Task to validate User Interface with stakeholder|Login interface was designed then a task to validate the new login interface that was created|

The **LEDS UP (Leds Unified Process)** is a software development framework and solution created by Recomb. The framework aims to provide best practices, guides, and methods that enable the development of appropriate solutions for clients.

It is important to note that, as a framework, users are not required to follow all the steps and tools to execute a project. Each project can implement the stages and tools according to its specific needs.

Additionally, unlike a software process book that describes step-by-step instructions, we will share our experiences accumulated over the years of the LEDS project. Therefore, there will be chapters that describe our lessons learned, mistakes, and successes in each phase of project management within the LEDS framework.

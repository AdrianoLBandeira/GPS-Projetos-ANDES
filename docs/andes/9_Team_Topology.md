title: Team Topology

The ANDES Project team was structured as a Platform Team, a strategic choice that aligns directly with the core purpose of the project: to develop a reusable solution that facilitates and standardizes software documentation for other teams.

In this case, the proposed solution is a VSCode extension aimed at the automated generation of technical documentation. In other words, it is a resource intended to be used by various development teams, with the goal of accelerating processes, reducing rework, and ensuring consistency in the production of artifacts.

### Why a Platform Team?

The adoption of the platform team typology follows the approach presented in the book *Team Topologies*, where such teams act as internal providers of tools, services, and components that other teams can consume in a self-service manner. In the case of the ANDES project, the extension serves as an "internal product" aimed at the community of developers and requirements analysts, providing essential features such as:

- Automatic generation of Markdown documents;

- Creation of diagrams and visual artifacts;

- Integration with support tools (such as Made and Spark);

- Support for different models of requirements and business rules.

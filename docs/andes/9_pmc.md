### PMC Components

The Project Model Canvas includes the following key components:

### Justification

Documentation in software development is often underestimated. When it is done, it tends to be inconsistent, time-consuming, and difficult to maintain. The lack of effective tools contributes to this scenario. The ANDES project aims to fill this gap by promoting the creation of clearer, standardized, and easily updatable documents.

### SMART Goal
To develop, within a 3-month period, with a team of 5 developers and 5 managers, a functional extension for VSCode that assists in the standardized creation of documentation for requirements, use cases, tests, and diagrams.

### Product

The main deliverable of the project will be a VSCode extension with the following features:

- Automated generation of requirements documentation

- Creation of Markdown files and test cases

- Ability to process descriptions of requirements, business rules, and use cases

- Generation of domain diagrams and documents compatible with tools like Made and Spark

### Benefits 

- Increased longevity and reusability of documentation

- Ease of creating and maintaining documents

- Significant reduction in time spent on documentation

- Greater standardization and professionalism in project records

### External Stakeholders

- LEDS 

- Software developers

- Systems analysts

### Assumptions

- ANDES project source code will be made available

- Team is allocated and available

- Support documentation is accessible to all members


### Constraints

- Short delivery time (3 months)

- Team has limited prior knowledge of the technologies involved

- Time zone differences among team members


### Risks

1. Delay in delivery

- Probability: High

- Impact: High

- Mitigation: Good organization and task distribution

2. Low engagement from the development team

- Probability: Low

- Impact: High

- Mitigation: Constant monitoring and active communication

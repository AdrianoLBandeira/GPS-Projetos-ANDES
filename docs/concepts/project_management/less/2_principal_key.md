Key Principles for an Agile and Continuous Development Organization:

1. The perfection goal is to have a releasable product all the time. Release stabilization periods need to be reduced and eventually eliminated.

2. Co-located, self-managing, cross-functional, Scrum teams are the basic organizational building block. Responsibility and accountability are on team level.

3. The majority of the teams are organized as customer-centric feature teams.

4. Product management steers the development through the Product Owner role. Release commitments are not forced on teams.

5. The line organization is cross-functional. The functional-specialized line organizations are gradually integrated in the cross-functional line organization.

6. Special coordination roles (such as project managers) are avoided and teams are responsible for coordination.

7. The main responsibility of management is improvement—improve team’s learning, efficiency, and quality. The content of the work always comes from the Product Owner.

8. There is no branching in development. And product variation is not to be reflected in the version control system.

9. All tests are automated with the exception of (1) exploratory test, (2) usability test, and (3) tests that require physical movement. All people must learn test automation skills.

10. Adoption is gradual and evolutionary. These principles are considered in every decision.

title: Eliminate internal dependencies
---

In LeSS, there is no need to manage internal dependencies. There’s more on this subject in the Organizing by Customer Value and the Coordination and Integration chapters.

There are no internal dependencies and no dependency management with feature teams that use shared code.  
Teams can benefit by working together on shared work but wouldn’t depend on the output of the other team.

Why? Any feature team can work across the code base for their items. And teams manage their coordination between themselves, applying ideas such as continuous integration, communities, multi-team workshops, and sharing and swapping work.

It’s not complicated, but it’s a huge mindset shift for a group that previously had component teams with private code, and traditional dependency management, such as via an integration team or big planning events.

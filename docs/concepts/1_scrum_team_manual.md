A clear definition of roles and responsibilities is essential to ensure effective management and the continuous delivery of value. Below, we outline the key responsibilities of Product Owners (POs), Scrum Masters, and the Chief Scrum Master.

## Product Owner

Product Owner (PO) represents the interests of all stakeholders, defines product features, and prioritizes Product Backlog items. Responsibilities of the Product Owner:

* Define product features (Product Backlog).
* Prioritize features based on business value.
* Adjust features and priorities as needed for each Sprint.
* Ensure the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all.
* Ensure the Development Team understands the Product Backlog items at the necessary level.
* Decide on the release date and content of the release.
* Accept or reject work results.

The Product Owner plays a crucial role in the Sprint Planning and Preparation events. Their participation is essential because the Product Backlog is defined and prioritized during the first event, while in the second, each Product Backlog item is clarified and estimated so that it can be selected for development. The Scrum Team reviews the prioritization of Product Backlog items, refines them according to priority, and commits to completing them during the Sprint. These items then become part of the Sprint Backlog.

In return for the Scrum Team's commitment to completing the selected tasks, the Product Owner commits to not imposing new requirements on the team during the Sprint. Changes to the requirements are permitted but only outside the Sprint.

## Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is responsible for facilitating the Scrum Team's daily work and Scrum events, aiming to increase team members' autonomy so that they can collaboratively develop the product, communicate effectively, and continuously improve their work processes, achieving quality and productivity. The Scrum Master acts as a liaison with project management but is not a project manager; rather, they are a facilitator leader who manages Scrum processes.

The Scrum Master’s responsibilities include:
- Promoting Scrum values and practices.
- Applying and disseminating management-defined standards within the team.
- Facilitating and ensuring the occurrence of daily stand-ups, planning sessions, and reviews.
- Ensuring the removal of impediments that hinder the Development Team's work and helping to prevent them whenever possible.
- Protecting the team from external interferences.
- Reporting impediments and team progress to the Chief Scrum Master.
- Monitoring Sprint tasks to ensure success, but not creating or assigning tasks—the team is responsible for this.
- Guiding and ensuring that tasks are created in Jira by the team.
- Facilitating the preparation of presentations for Scrum events.
- Ensuring the team is fully functional and productive.
- Enabling close cooperation between all roles and functions.
- Assisting in creating roadmaps for the team.
- Facilitating the definition of the team’s "Definition of Done."
- Helping define the team's principles and values.
- Assisting with the onboarding of new members.

## Chief Scrum Master

The Chief Scrum Master is responsible for coordinating and supporting the Scrum Masters, ensuring process consistency, supporting continuous improvement, and reporting to management.

The Chief Scrum Master's responsibilities include:
- Participating in daily stand-ups, planning sessions, and reviews of the teams.
- Guiding and ensuring the creation of tasks in Jira with the Scrum Master.
- Assisting in creating roadmaps for the team.
- Removing and reporting team impediments to management.
- Applying and disseminating management-defined standards within the teams.
- Facilitating the onboarding of new members.
- Facilitating the definition of principles and values for the teams.
- Facilitating the construction of the "Definition of Done" for team activities.

## Development Team

The Development Team is a multidisciplinary group responsible for the end-to-end development of the product. Based on the priorities set by the Product Owner, the Development Team generates tasks in each Sprint that add value to the product.

The responsibilities of the Development Team include:
- Participating in daily stand-ups, planning sessions, and reviews.
- Contributing to the creation of presentations for Scrum events.
- Keeping their tasks updated in Jira.
- Applying and following standards defined by the team and for the team.
- Assisting in defining the team’s principles and values.
- Following best development practices.
- Assisting in the creation of the team’s "Definition of Done" for tasks.

- Creating test code and components.

- Designing and documenting the database project (or defining standards to be followed).
- Designing and documenting project diagrams (packages, classes).
- Ensuring the quality of deliverables.

## Design Team

The responsibilities of the Design Team include:
- Conducting usability and interface testing with end-users.
- Creating a Design System.
- Assisting in the development of the user interface.

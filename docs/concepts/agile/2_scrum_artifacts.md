title: Scrum Artifacts
---

Scrum artifacts represent work or value, providing transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation. The artifacts defined in Scrum are specifically designed to maximize the transparency of key information so that everyone has a shared understanding of the artifacts. 

## Product Backlog

The Product Backlog is managed by the Product Owner and contains the ordered list of items to be developed by the Development Team for the product. These work items are expressed in the form of user needs, business objectives from customers and stakeholders, or product features.

The Product Backlog is constantly evolving and is never finished or complete. Initial developments only establish the requirements that are initially known and better understood. As the product evolves, the Product Backlog is frequently modified by adding, removing, reordering, and changing its items. The product evolves as the environment changes, and as both customers and the Development Team gain a better understanding of the product being built.

## Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Backlog is a set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint. The list of items chosen for the Sprint Backlog is the result of collaboration between the Development Team and the Product Owner during the Sprint Planning Meeting. These items are moved from the Product Backlog to the Sprint Backlog that is being created.

The Sprint Backlog exists only in the context of its corresponding Sprint. It is created during the Sprint Planning Meeting and ceases to exist after the Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective meetings of its Sprint. The Sprint Backlog belongs to the Development Team, who is responsible for its use and maintenance, and it serves as an important tool for organizing work during the Sprint.

It is crucial that the Sprint Backlog always reflects the current status, and it is expected to evolve and be updated throughout the Sprint to reflect the remaining work. Thus, the Sprint Backlog is not static: although the selected items for the Sprint should not be modified, the Development Team updates their tasks whenever there is a change, such as progress in the status of a task, re-estimation, addition, or removal of a task.

However, a significant amount of changes that make it difficult or even impossible to achieve the Sprint Goal generally indicate failures in Sprint planning. The estimate of remaining work in the Sprint is calculated daily and represented graphically, resulting in a Burnup Chart.

# OKR Methodology

The approach to be addressed in this document is inspired by elements of the OKR methodology, an acronym for **Objectives and Key Results**, which proposes the development of objectives as well as key results that will be used to measure the effectiveness of the proposed actions.

In general terms, OKR consists of a system of collective and individual goals that converge towards the pursuit of an organization's global objectives. 

## Objectives

The writing of objectives should be guided by the question “What will I do?”. Objectives can be either operational, focusing on the day-to-day activities and immediate results of the company, or aspirational, with a long-term focus, aiming to inspire and motivate teams with ambitious goals that are essential for business growth.

Objectives can be defined at both the project level (ConectaFapes) and the organizational level (LEDS), so they are reflected in the daily routine of ConectaFapes. The responsibility for defining objectives can rest solely with the project’s Committee members or may include roles such as Scrum Masters, General Scrum Master, and Product Owners, depending on the need.

## Key Results

To achieve these objectives, key results are established, guided by the question “How will I do it?”. They are direct consequences of the objectives, and one suggestion is to apply the SMART method (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound) to define them.

### Example:

Consider the objective “Process payment via Prodest to pay FAPES scholarships,” defined as a delivery milestone for the third quarter of 2024 (Q3/2024). Once the objective is set, we can then write the key results as follows:

| Responsible Team  | Key Result  | Delivery  |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Development       | **KR1: Implement Integration with Prodest** | Develop and test the integration with the Prodest payment system by the end of August 2024. |
| Development       | **KR2: Validate Scholarship Recipients' Data** | Register and validate the scholarship recipients' data by mid-September 2024. |
| Development       | **KR3: Conduct Pilot Payment** | Conduct a pilot payment with a selected group of scholarship recipients by October 15, 2024. |

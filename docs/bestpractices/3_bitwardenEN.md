# Bitwarden

#### Bitwarden is a free and open-source password manager that has never had its security compromised (unlike LastPass).

Regular use of Bitwarden or any password manager is not only recommended but virtually MANDATORY in an environment with sensitive information. The use of **send** for sensitive information is **INDISPENSABLE**.

# Installation

I recommend using the web version of Bitwarden, both the common web app and the browser extension. In this tutorial, I'll use the Mozilla Firefox extension, but the procedure is similar in other versions.

1. Access your extension store:
   For Chromium-based browsers (Edge, Chrome, etc):
   https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bitwarden-password-manager/nngceckbapebfimnlniiiahkandclblb
   For Firefox:
   https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/?browser=firefox
   (*_it's available for all mainstream browsers, but if you're not using one of those listed here, you need to reconsider._*)

2. Download the extension and pin it:

   *Click to pin*

3. Log in or create your account in the extension:
   Click on the Bitwarden icon to open the extension.
   Log in with your email address and master password that you created when making your account. Or create one if you haven't done so yet.

4. REMOVE AUTOCOMPLETE.
   Autocomplete is very disruptive and ends up hindering you and makes you very angry, for your own good, disable it in the options.

Ready! Your Bitwarden is ready for use.

# Tips

Use Bitwarden to store all your passwords. To create a new secret, go to *VAULT*.

There are several types of secrets:
- **Login**: Use to store login information, such as username and password for websites and applications.
- **Card**: Use to store credit and debit card information, including card number, expiration date, and security code.
- **Identity**: Use to store personal information, such as full name, address, phone number, and other identification data.
- **Secure Note**: Use to store any type of confidential information that doesn't fit into other categories, such as private notes, keys, or sensitive information.

These types of secrets help organize and protect your information securely and accessibly.

# Send

Bitwarden's **Send** feature allows you to send information securely to other people. This is useful for sharing passwords, secure notes, or any other type of confidential information without compromising security.

To send information using Send:
1. Go to the **Send** section in Bitwarden.
2. Create a new send, filling in the necessary details.
3. Share the generated link with the person who should receive the information.

At LEDS, all information must be sent using Bitwarden's **Send** feature to ensure the security and confidentiality of shared data. Under penalty of death, or something worse.

You can define a maximum number of opens and a password through it. IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU USE THESE FEATURES AND DESTROY THE SEND RIGHT AFTER USE. I AM SERIOUS.

### Bitwarden may seem like a lot, but security is never too much. It's really indispensable.

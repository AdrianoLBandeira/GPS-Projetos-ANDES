title: Knowledge Management

## Objective
To inform the best practices adopted for knowledge management in the project and guide how to follow them.

## Importance of Knowledge Management

In the context of software development, knowledge management is crucial to ensure the continuity and efficiency of projects. It enables the capture, organization, and dissemination of accumulated knowledge, facilitating problem-solving, innovation, and continuous process improvement. Through knowledge management, teams can reduce repetitive errors and speed up the onboarding of new members, ensuring that technical and strategic know-how is preserved and accessible, contributing to the quality and competitiveness of the software developed.

## Knowledge Identification

Before documenting knowledge, it is essential to identify and categorize it. Currently, we consider the following categories of knowledge:

| Category   | Description                                                                 | Example                                                                           |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Specific** | Detailed and particular knowledge about specific technologies, frameworks, tools, or processes. | Guide on the microservices architecture used in the previous ConectaFapes system.  |
| **Generic**  | Broad knowledge applicable to various contexts and projects, generally related to principles, methodologies, and common practices in the software industry. | Agile development practices like Scrum or Kanban.                                  |
| **Internal** | Knowledge generated and accumulated within the project, including internal processes and proprietary code. | Internal documentation on the best coding practices and design patterns adopted by the team. |
| **External** | Knowledge obtained from external sources such as academic research, developer communities, and others. | New AI techniques published in an article by an expert.                            |

Regarding the format of documentation, it depends on the need... Some information is better presented in video format, others in text, and so on. Additionally, the author's ease and limitations in a particular type of documentation should be considered. The method of disseminating knowledge is closely related to its categorization, which must be done correctly.

## Tools for Knowledge Documentation and Dissemination

Here are the tools currently used by the teams for documenting and disseminating knowledge:

### Discord: Forums

On the Discord server, there are two main forums: the general forum for publications visible to the entire LEDS community and the project forum, visible only to ConectaFapes project members.

- **General Forum:** Accessible and free to use by all server members.
- **ConectaFapes Project Forum:** Exclusively accessible to ConectaFapes members.

In the general forum, internal and external knowledge can be shared with a focus on generic information that can be applied to various LEDS projects. Specific knowledge, which may only be useful in the context of ConectaFapes, should be shared in the project forum.

When creating a post in a forum, you can write a text of up to 2007 characters, attaching images for context. You can use this space to document all knowledge or just share links to where the information is located. Others can add comments to enrich the discussion on the topic.

### Dev.to

Dev.to is an online and open-source community for software developers, where devs can share ideas, learn from each other, and collaborate on projects. The platform offers a variety of resources, including:

- **Articles and Blogs:** Members can write and publish articles on various software development topics, from tutorials and guides to discussions on trends and best practices.
- **Discussions:** The platform allows developers to ask questions, answer others' doubts, and participate in technical discussions.
- **Projects and Code:** Users can share their open-source projects, get feedback, and collaborate with other developers.

The platform can be useful not only for documenting knowledge obtained in the ConectaFapes project but also as a portfolio for your personal projects. For knowledge that is better suited for dissemination in text/article format, we recommend publishing it on Dev.to. The platform accepts Markdown format! You can write your text there (using your personal account, of course) and save it as a draft if necessary.

**⚠️ ALWAYS ADD THE HASHTAG #LEDSCOMMUNITY WHEN POSTING ON DEV.TO**

For posts related to LEDS and its projects, using the #ledscommunity hashtag is mandatory. This is because the hashtag helps aggregate content related to LEDS, making it easier for community members to find and follow posts, discussions, and updates. Consistent use of #ledscommunity also increases the visibility of projects and contributes to strengthening the LEDS community's identity and engagement. When publishing an article on Dev.to, inform via Discord.

### LEDS YouTube

For knowledge better suited for video format, publications should be made on LEDS's official YouTube channel. If you have a video to be posted, inform the demand on Discord, and the LEDS social media scholarship holder will contact you.

Access the LEDS channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/LEDS).


## Sprint Materials

Regarding information from Sprints, such as task records, timeboxes, Sprint Review and Planning slides, meeting minutes, and similar documents, the approach is different. This type of knowledge is not disclosed to the external public; that is, the information should only be available to project stakeholders (client, sponsor, managers, team).

**Sprint Reviews**

For Sprint Reviews, we use slides as a documentation method. Files should be saved on Drive in the respective team folders (Teams). The template to be followed is: `MonthYear_Team_SprintReviews`. The file should be named as follows: `MonthYear_TeamName_SprintReviews`. Example: `May2024_DesignTeam_SprintReviews`

As you may have noticed, Sprint Reviews will be grouped by month in a single file. This reinforces the need for objective presentations, as in the example below:

Always include links to applications, repositories, prototypes, and similar resources in the slides whenever possible. Although the SCRUM Master is responsible for guiding the Review and ensuring that the slides are properly assembled, the entire team should contribute to building the material, with the SCRUM Master being the validator of the proposed material.

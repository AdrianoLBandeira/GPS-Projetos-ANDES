title: Agile Manifest
---

The Agile Manifest is a declaration that emphasizes that computing, in this case, project development, should be more human-centered than technical. This human aspect was lost long ago in the pursuit of making it an extremely precise field. Thus, this manifesto asserts that we should be human and focused on solving the client's problem (a person like us).

The four values of the Agile Manifesto describe this more human approach to developing solutions:

1. **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**
2. **Working software over comprehensive documentation**
3. **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**
4. **Responding to change over following a plan**

While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

Notice that the values of the Agile Manifesto are key elements for developing innovative solutions. These solutions always require good interactions with the individuals involved in the project and potential changes at the project's end. Who hasn't experienced this? This manifesto represents what truly happens in a real project.

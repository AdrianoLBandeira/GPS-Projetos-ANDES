title: Complex Adaptive System
---

A **complex adaptive system** is a special case of a "complex system." It is complex because it is not in equilibrium, dynamic, and never at rest; adaptive because its agents, through their interaction with the system, can exchange information with it and adapt to itâ€”that is, learn. In other words, they are influenced by and influence the system to which they belong.

When we view an organization as a system composed of elements (e.g., teams, artifacts, and policies) and interconnections (e.g., the relationship between the development team, the software artifacts they produce, and the policies that influenced their production) coherently organized into a structure that produces a set of characteristic behaviors, often classified as its functions or the system's purpose (e.g., the development team produces a software product aimed at fulfilling one or more functions within the organization).

On the other hand, small actions by a team member or an unmet rule can positively or negatively affect a software project. A project is a system of elements that interact with each other. Complexity is a characteristic of a project or its environment that is difficult to manage due to human behavior, system behavior, and ambiguity. The nature and number of interactions determine the degree of complexity in a project. Complexity arises from the project's elements, the interactions between the project's elements, and the interactions with other systems and the project's environment. Although complexity cannot be controlled, project teams can modify their activities to manage the impacts that occur as a result of complexity.

Project teams often fail to anticipate the emergence of complexity because it results from many interactions, such as risks, dependencies, events, or relationships. Alternatively, some causes may converge to produce a single complex effect, making it difficult to isolate a specific cause of complexity.

Project complexity occurs as a result of individual elements within the project and the project's system as a whole. For example, complexity within a project can be amplified with a greater number or diversity of stakeholders, such as regulatory agencies, international financial institutions, multiple suppliers, numerous specialized subcontractors, or local communities. These stakeholders can have a significant impact on the complexity of a project, both individually and collectively.

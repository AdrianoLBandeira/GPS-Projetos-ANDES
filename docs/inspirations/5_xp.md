> *eXtreme Programming (XP) is an agile software development methodology aimed at small to medium-sized teams, where requirements are vague and frequently changing.*

(Daniel Wildt, Dionatan Moura, Guilherme Lacerda, Rafael Helm, eXtreme Programming)

The concepts presented in this section are taken from the book *eXtreme Programming: Practices for Day-to-Day Agile Software Development*.

XP is based on the following values:

* **Communication**: This is the essential part of a project. After all, it is the primary means of transmitting and exchanging information and knowledge. Do this through face-to-face conversations or with a whiteboard. The simpler, the better!
* **Simplicity**: This is the key to agile projects. Be as simple and focused on the work as possible, thereby delivering what truly adds value.
* **Feedback**: This should be done at every moment in the project and with everyone involved. The more it occurs, the better it is for the project.
* **Courage**: Have the courage to change what is not right in a project, following good project and conduct practices.
* **Respect**: Respect your team members and the client. It’s as simple as that.

These values guide us in developing a good team. After all, without good communication, there is no good project. Poor communication is the third leading cause of project failure. See other causes of project failures in this [link](#).

Direct and simple communication is necessary. Believe it, a good chat is better than a 1000-line email. The figure below presents the values and techniques found in eXtreme Programming.

Being simple is the key to a project’s success and its biggest challenge. After all, thinking about complex things full of technologies is easy. But thinking of a simple and cost-effective solution that meets the client’s needs is complex.

Continuous feedback is a powerful tool for the continuous improvement of the project. Through this tool, it is possible to identify various issues in the project, such as dissatisfaction from the client or the team with some aspect of the project. Continuous feedback from everyone involved in the project must be encouraged. Without this, there is no success.

Courage and respect are values that should be inherent in any solution development team. Everyone should have the courage to change what is wrong in the project and should respect the members involved in the project.

In addition to the values presented, there are other concepts that are also important in XP and have a direct impact on a project’s success. XP proposes that a development team should be cohesive, m

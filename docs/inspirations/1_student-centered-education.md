title: Student-Centered Education
---

As described in *21st Century Skills* (2016), there is a growing sentiment among educators that students need to understand more than just classroom content to succeed in today's world. This is because new global demands require people to have interdisciplinary skills and the ability to work in teams.

To achieve the aforementioned goals, students need to acquire the following skills for the 21st century:

- **Critical Thinking and Problem Solving**: The ability to share thoughts, questions, ideas, and solutions about an aspect of the world;
- **Effective Communication**: The skill of working together to achieve a goal, i.e., combining individual talent, life experience, and intelligence to propose solutions;
- **Collaboration**: The ability to view a problem from different perspectives and thus integrate various fields and subjects to solve the problem;
- **Creativity and Innovation**: The ability to create new approaches to solving problems.

From the student learning perspective, when the 4Cs are integrated through a teaching approach focused on problem-solving and group work, the sense of Collaboration is naturally promoted, Critical Thinking is achieved, and Creativity and Innovation are enhanced through the iterations, knowledge, and experiences of the group members. After all, as described by *Saito* (2015), students working in small collaborative groups to achieve a common project goal is a good strategy for reaching curricular objectives and learning standards.

Among the various approaches present in the literature, two Experiential Learning approaches stand out for promoting the mentioned skills through group work development and integrating the classroom with the world: *Learning by Doing* and *Project-Based Learning* (PrBL). Both approaches use the principles of student-centered learning. It is important to note that Experiential Learning occurs when learners are actively engaged in an activity or learning experiment. *Learning By Doing* is an example of how to apply Experiential Learning.

Further, from the perspective of Experiential Learning, *DuFour et al.* (2013) concluded that students learn best when they are actively engaged in an activity or experiment within the learning process. This is because, as described by *Kolb* (2014), such a learning approach has the following characteristics:
- Encourages students to want to know more about the problem and its surrounding elements;
- The solution to the problem is unknown, thus motivating creativity and innovation;
- With the student motivated, they will learn about the content.

Project-Based Learning (PrBL) is an approach that places the student at the center of learning and the teacher as a facilitator (*Chandrasekaran*, 2013). This approach provides students with the opportunity to develop leadership, collaboration, cooperation, ownership of the solution, public presentation, writing, and technology skills.

According to *Larmer et al.* (2015), there are six characteristics that teachers or instructional designers should be aware of for a project using PrBL:
- The project should be the main vehicle for teaching content within the discipline;
- The task of solving the problem should be the student's responsibility;
- The project should be done in teams and collaboratively;
- The task should be completed under the teacher's supervision during class time;
- The project should involve an investigative process and the creation of a product; and
- The product generated should be authentic and useful for the real world, for the student, or for both.

Finally, from the assessment perspective, formative assessment is a model that allows measuring the development of the 4Cs and student learning. *Black and Wiliam* (2009) developed a framework that contextualizes formative assessment into the following strategies:
- Clarify and share learning intentions and success criteria with students;
- Create an effective discussion dynamic in the classroom or another learning method that highlights student learning;
- Provide feedback that helps learners move towards success;
- Transform students into teaching tools for other students;
- Make students responsible for their own learning.

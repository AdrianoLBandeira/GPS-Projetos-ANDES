Project-Based Learning (PBL) is an excellent way to teach two things: (a) social skills and (b) that life is simply "ALL MIXED UP," as shown in the figure below.

When working on a project, students need to learn various skills that are important for anyone wanting to live in society. Examples of these skills include:
- Listening and accepting that your opinion may not be as good as that of another team member;
- Trusting each team member;
- Knowing that everyone has an important role in the team;
- Recognizing that each member has a skill that complements the team;
- Understanding that communication is one of the key factors for team and project success; and
- Working in a team is an art that always needs to be refined.

Regarding the idea that life is "All Mixed Up," this is clearly expressed in Project-Based Learning. After all, to create a good and real project, it is necessary to mix various areas in the same place. In other words, as illustrated in the figure above, a real project requires blending different competencies and knowledge (represented by colors) throughout its execution to achieve successful completion.
